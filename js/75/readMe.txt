I spent a lot of time on the persistent favorites feature. Try it out. In the info window click add to favorites.
I have a large 4k screen and I realized that the layout might get messed up on lower resolution screens.

I loaded my api keys via a json file so it's easy to add to the gitignore.
I don't mind my api keys being out there since I feel it's restricted enough. 
If my keys don't work for you replace them with yours to test.
